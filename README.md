Implemented the REINFORCE with Baseline and One-Step Actor-Critic algorithms and conducted
experiments on three distinct Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): Cartpole, Acrobot, and Lunar Lander. The
performance of each algorithm was analyzed across these environments to assess their effectiveness and convergence.
